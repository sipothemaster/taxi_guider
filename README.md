# Taxi Driver Guiding System with Deep Reinforcement Learning

In everyday life, we observe that experienced taxi drivers tend to know where and when high-value rides are available, and will intentionally move toward these areas after dropping off passengers to optimize their earnings for the day. The concentration of many drivers near airports or train stations is a good example. Novice drivers, however, are unfamiliar with the environment and can only wait in place for the next passenger or casually explore the surrounding area, resulting in potentially lower earnings than skilled drivers.

This study aims to develop a guiding system that helps novice drivers increase their income through system guiding, even when they are unfamiliar with the environment. Moreover, given our full knowledge of the environment and the ability of reinforcement learning to understand future rewards, we further compare whether this system performs better than experienced drivers who focus on timely high-value ride rewards.

We built the project based on the [TLC Trip Record Data - TLC](https://www.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page), which includes key information of taxi trip records in New York over time.
